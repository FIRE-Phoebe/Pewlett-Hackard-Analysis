# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett-Hackard Analysis project uses SQL techniques to design and manage employee database. The Entity Relationship Diagram helps us to create multiple tables, perform data modeling, and complete employment analysis for Pewlett-Hackard Company. Our purpose is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees to eligible for Mentorship Program.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
Use images as support where needed.
